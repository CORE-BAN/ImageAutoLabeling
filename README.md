# Image Auto Labeling

This project based on captioning [model](https://huggingface.co/nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning) and NER model.

## TODO

- [x] Make dataset scraping script
- [ ] Make bulk image labeling logic
- [ ] Make high level logic
- [ ] Add evaluation

**Paradox that asked by my friend**: If one could auto label, then why need to train another model?
